# Woofr

## Purpose:

Woofr is an application that provides its users with a platform to buy and sell dogs. It’s purpose is to make finding dogs in shelters or dogs from breeders streamlined and fun.

## Concept:
### Description
Modelled after modern dating apps, users can upload dogs that they are selling, or create an account as a buyer
Buyers are able to set preferences for types of dogs that they are looking for, and then swipe through the selection of dogs uploaded by sellers
If a buyer “swipes right” on a dog, a conversation is automatically started between the buyer and the seller where they can learn more about each other and can decide if the buyer is the right match for the dog

### Motivation
To create a streamlined and easy way to find dogs homes

### Typical user
An individual is looking for a dog, either in a shelter or from a breeder
The individual has specific preferences for dog adoption (both buyers and sellers)
They want to find dogs that match their specific criteria

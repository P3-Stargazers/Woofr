when user presses yes on a dog the user id must be sent to a "friends" collection tied in with the buyers id.

Seller matches =>

        ("friend added to collection" either login name added or unique id) =>

            (friend now shows on friends list => room is created between matches) =>

                (if user disconnects => room still must exist)
